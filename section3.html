    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein
     individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized database using strong 
     cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of
      coin ownership.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency#cite_note-crypto_currency-1">[1]</a>

Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. 
      Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).[3] When a 
      cryptocurrency(line break here~> <br>is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized.
       When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves 
       as a public financial transaction database.
